# Simple Weather & Forecast App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple weather and forecast app developed with **React** and the weather data provided by [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org).

I'm using the browsers geolocation features for detecting user location based on device latitude and longitude then get the weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API call. Users can refuse to activate the geolocation feature in their browser. Instead, users can use the search feature. Just type the city name and ***voila!***.
